# Pick and Park Machine Learning 


## Features
> This application functions by detecting a parking spot
> and calculating it's size. It then detects a vehicle 
> and determines the type and length of the vehicle.

## Running the Algorithm
- python object_size.py --image images/example_01.png --width 0.955
- python object_size.py --image images/example_01.png --width 500
